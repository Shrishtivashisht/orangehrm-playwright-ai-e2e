# AI Workflow Documentation

## Purpose
Use structured prompts to guide AI (Copilot/LLM) in generating consistent,
maintainable Playwright automation code.

AI is **not** used at runtime.
AI is used at **development time** to accelerate code creation.

## Workflow
1. Write requirements in prompt.md
2. Use Copilot to generate Pages and Tests
3. Review and refactor generated code
4. Commit clean, production‑ready code

## Why this works
- Faster development
- Consistent structure
- Full human control
- Interview‑safe and realistic
